# Packaging stuff

Learning to package stuff for various purposes. Each folder includes an attempt
for each kind of repository, e.g. pip for Python, flatpak, deb, rpm, etc. Maybe
even Windows exe or msi will come into this at some point?

## pip for Python

There is a [pip tutorial][pip] provided by the Python folks. I'll start with it
since that seems to be low-hanging fruit.
